You can see translations [there](https://github.com/stepanzubkov/year-progress-extended/tree/main/plasmoid/translate). 

# Translation guide

This guide assumes your basic knowledge of linux and git. If you do not have enough knowledge, firstly read another tutorial and come back to this.

## 1. Preparation

Firstly, decide on the language. Most likely it will be your native language, so there should be no problems at this point.

If there is not translations for your language, you can work on this! If there is, check translations and leave an issue if there are problems.

Then install programm for translations. I use and recommend [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) - the simple and intuitive \*.po files editor.

## 2. Translation

Create a fork of this project. To do that, click on the "Fork" button and fill out the form.

Then open project in Poedit. Fill out translations and save file. Also specify your name and email in file header.

Thorougly check your translations. Probably you are the only translator in your language team.

## 3. Contribution

Push changes to github repo and open pull request. Then I will merge your pull request and your translations will appear in next release.

Good luck! :)
